                <h3> Career Goals</h3>
                <p>I hope to aquire a position in the aerospace industry. I am interested in working on flight software or ground software for science missions. I am also interested in systems engineering in aerospace and the overall organization and processes that lead to a successful mission.</p>
                <p>I have learned various technologies in web development that have been implemented in the creation of this web application. Some of these technologies are described below:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>React</strong>: React is a tool that provides a framework that maps components declared by the web developer to the browser's DOM tree. This allows the web developer to create components that can be reused.</li>
                    <li><strong>MongoDB</strong>: MongoDB is a database management system (DBMS) that helps manage a database, or collection of data, and supports operations with large data sets amongst a large number of users.</li>
                    <li><strong>Node</strong>: Node.js provides an environment for running server-side JavaScript web applications. </li>
                    <li><strong>Express</strong>: Express is a tool that works with Node and allows for the use of Application Programming Interfaces (API) for frequently used tasks. </li>
                    <li><strong>JSON</strong>: JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a tool used to tranfer data between multiple applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>REST</strong>: REST Client provides a way to send HTTP requests such as POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE to a REST API while using Visual Studio Code  </li>
                    <li><strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to apply customized structure and style to the web application.</li>
                    <li><strong>MERN</strong>: Mern is a tool used to implement a web app using JavaScript through the combination of MongoDB, Express, React and Node. </li>
                </ol>
